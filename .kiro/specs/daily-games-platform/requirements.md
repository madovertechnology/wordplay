# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Daily Games Platform is a Laravel-based web application that hosts multiple simple daily games with a shared user system. The platform will initially feature a Daily Word Scramble game, with plans to add more games in the future (such as trivia, math puzzles, tile puzzles, etc.). Each game will have its own logic and data while sharing core platform features like user authentication, leaderboards, and streak tracking. The platform aims to provide an engaging daily gaming experience where users can compete, track their progress, and switch between different games.
